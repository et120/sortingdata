**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

### Project Scope: 

This was a `Time-Crunch Sprint` challenge where I built out a `data sorting app` that allows you to sort in ascending and descending order in each field. This was a `desktop build` that utilized `vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML`, and the `Bootstrap Framework`. 

- This challenge was fun to work on as I am a big fan of Microsoft Excel (*which was the inspiration behind my minimal design*), and I had the opportunity to learn more about the `.sort()` method. The code could use some refactoring if it is to be revisited in the future.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project was part of a sprint challenge series that focused on functionality first, meeting the client's requirements, and supplying a working product prior to the time-crunched deadline. **There is opportunity to improve the UI & UX design and responsiveness, if desired.**
